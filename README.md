# CD2mp3
Small script to convert a music CD to MP3

# How to use it

1. Please change the "year" and "genre" in the file, getting this from an external source was unreliable.
2. Create the folder structure as you see fit and change into the destination folder
3. Run the script, eg by cd'ing to the destination folder and run "sh CD2mp3". It should work with multiple shell.
4. Open the folder in parallel while the script is running and check the first files when they're done
5. Answer "y" at the end of the script if everything is ok to get rid of the temporary stuff
6. Enjoy the music! :D
